#In complexity theory, I am mostly excited by the following two fundamental questions: (1) Can we prove certain problems are inherently hard to compute? (e.g., is P equal to NP?) and (2) Is randomness inherently required for efficient computation? (is BPP equal to P?). For (1), I have proved several [https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/010/ state]-[https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/150/ of]-[https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2023/144/ the]-[https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2024/182/ art] lower bounds via connection to algorithms; For (2), I have proposed a [https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2023/094/ new framework] for studying [https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/080/ derandomization] that is inspired by ideas from cryptography, which also gives a [https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2023/076/ new algorithm] for finding canonical primes ([https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-to-build-a-big-prime-number-20230713/ quanta magazine]); see my [RS.pdf research statement] for more detail on my research.

#In particular, I am interested in classical and quantum computational complexity theory and their connections to other fields of computer science and quantum physics.

I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley. I am honored to be part of Berkeley's [http://theory.cs.berkeley.edu/ Theory Group]. Prior to that, I was a Miller Research Fellow at UC Berkeley, hosted by [https://www.avishaytal.org/ Avishay Tal] and [https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/ Umesh V. Vazirani]. I got my Ph.D. from MIT, and I was very fortunate to be advised by [https://people.csail.mit.edu/rrw/ Ryan Williams]. I received my bachelor's degree from the [http://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/ Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences] at Tsinghua University.

At Tsinghua University, I was advised by Prof. [http://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jianli/ Jian Li]. During the Spring of 2016, I was visiting MIT, working under the supervision of Prof. [https://www.scottaaronson.com/ Scott Aaronson]. [CV.pdf \[CV\]]

*Research Interests*: I have a broad interest in theoretical computer science, especially in fundamental questions in complexity theory, and also in applying the ideas of theoretical computer science to other scientific fields such as quantum physics and AI safety.\n

*Some questions that I am excited about*:
- How to make progress towards P vs. NP?
- Is randomness inherently required for efficient computation? ([https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2023/094/ is BPP equal to P]?)
- How does quantum complexity theory shed light on [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.05903 quantum] [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04978 physics]?
- How can we apply ideas from theoretical computer science to establish safety guarantees for AI systems?

Textbook hardness-to-randomness converts circuit lower bounds into PRGs. But is this black-box approach really necessary for derandomization? In this new work we revamp the classical hardness-to-randomness framework, showing how to convert new types of <b>uniform lower bounds</b> into <b>non-black-box derandomization</b>, deducing conclusions such as promiseBPP = promiseP without PRGs. Moreover, we show that the same types of lower bounds are in fact <u>necessary</u> for any type of derandomization! This reveals a tight connection between any derandomization of promiseBPP (i.e., not necessarily a black-box one) and the foregoing new types of uniform lower bounds.
<br><br>Our framework also allows a flexible trade-off between hardness and randomness. In an extreme setting, we show that plausible uniform lower bounds imply that "<b>randomness is indistinguishable from useless</b>". That is, every randomized algorithm can be derandomized with an arbitrarily small polynomial overhead, such that no polynomial-time algorithm can find a mistake with non-negligible probability.

The natural proof barrier does not seem to apply here since <b>Hardness Magnification</b> (HM) theorems only work for special functions. So one natural question stemmed from the hardness magnification phenomenon is to understand whether there is another inherent barrier, which prevents us from using current techniques to prove the lower bounds required by HM theorems.
<br><br>We formulated a concrete barrier called <b>Locality Barrier</b>. Roughly speaking, the locality barrier says that if your lower bounds methods are robust enough to handle small-fan-in oracles, then it cannot be used to prove the lower bounds required by HM theorems. Unfortunately, it seems most lower bounds techniques we are aware of (random restrictions, approximation method, communication complexity based lower bounds, etc.) are subject to this barrier.

By proving lower bounds against dominated protocols, we also prove lower bounds for selection and learning-parity against multi-message shuffle-DP protocols.
<br><br><b> Moment Matching and Poissonization:</b> Inspired by the Poissonization and moment matching techniques in the context of property testing. Our lower bounds are proved by (1) constructing two hard distributions on datasets (2) expressing the histogram of applying any $(\ln n - 7 \ln\ln n, n^{-\omega(1)})$-DP on a distribution of datasets as a sum of many independent mixtures of multi-dimensional Poisson distributions. (3) Using the moment-matching technique to bound the statistical distance between two mixtures of multi-dimensional Poisson distributions.
